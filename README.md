## ‚òº SOLIPSES ‚òæ

24, it/she/ask/any

read my links to get to know more about me! >:3 

i am a disabled full-time artist. i work remotely at home and i have 2 monitors. i usually keep ponytown open on my 2nd monitor and tab in to people watch

i'm very friendly and excitable and social and i LOVE talking to new people, but i'm usually offtab. whispers are the best way to reach me since i'm usually looking at the personal chat tab anyway!!

now onto "scarier" stuff that's going to make me look scarier than i actually am:

## NOTICE

my skins are **not** yours to copy, colorpick, or take inspiration from.

i put a lot of love and care into my ponytown skins! the fun in it is the creativity that goes into it. please embrace your creativity and make your own too, even if it doesn't look perfect to you!!!

i do not want to involve myself in drama or conflict. i do not like harassing or bullying people.

drama is stressful and i'm stressed enough as it is and i don't think my heart can take much more of it üëç

please don't spread gossip about me or take gossip you hear about me as fact, because chances are it probably isn't. everything you hear on ponytown is just hear-say.

if you hear something about me, please contact me and i can explain my side of things too. but honestly most things are just related to interpersonal stuff that should be kept private in the first place, or massive misunderstandings/misinterpretations that could be cleared up with mild communication lol

---

i am blunt and confrontational. if you do or say something that makes me uncomfortable or rubs me the wrong way i will speak up and be direct with you about it. 

this is not equitable to being harassed. if you think adult confrontation and being held accountable for your actions that affect other people is harassment, i can only pray that you'll make it in society.

if i say anything to you that seems angry, hostile, or aggressive in any way, there is a 99% chance that you are misinterpreting my tone. if you annoy me i'll just hide you. i don't engage with things that get a rise out of me. i get stressed out more than i get angry LOL

## thank you.
